Here is how Dan lost his SEO business (the first time): At 25 (2012) he was
diagnosed with Kidney failure. There was no warning.  Stuck in hospital
for a month, Dan lost his entire client list. Since Dan only provided
high-touch 'White-Hat' link building - with no stupid tricks - there was no
way he could build high-quality links for clients while lying in a hospital
bed fighting for his life.

As soon as Dan got out of hospital he quickly rebuilt his client list... only
to be sent back to hospital again with an even more serious condition both
(Diabetes and Kidney failure.) That is when Dan knew he had to find a way to
systematize - the un-systematizable: Build a white-hat link building agency
that would run on auto-pilot even if Dan had to dissapear for months (battling his own body).

These days all Dan has to do is manage a small team of VAs (he only meets with
them once a week...if that) while working with some of the top some of the largest
companies in the UK.  Each client happily paying over $10,000 a
month for Dan's high-touch, elite service.   Most people focus on trying to
"game" the search engines - when the only thing that really works is mastering
pure 'white hat', quality link building.  SEO services are some of the greatest
SCAMs ever.  Linkbuilding: getting website owners, journalists, and bloggers
to take a geniune REAL interest in your content,  is one of
the few honest, and effective areas of SEO it is also the area
that
clients want to pay the most money for.   Contray to popular belief, there is
more money (a lot more money) in doing SEO the white hat way.
