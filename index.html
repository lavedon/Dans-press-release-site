	<li>Tips for winning clients through Facebook ads</li>
	</ul>
	
	</p>
	<p> Here is how Dan lost his SEO business (the first time): At age 25 (2012) Dan was diagnosed with Kidney failure. There was no warning. Stuck in hospital for a month, Dan lost his entire client list.  Since Dan only provided high-touch 'White-Hat' link building -- each link he won required a deep knowledge of the</p>

	</ul>
	<p>art of building links.  There was no way Dan could outsource the &rsquo;nitty gritty&rsquor; details of what needed to be done to win each link. 
	</p>

	<div class="middle_bullets">
	<ul>
	<li>The fastest way to gain credibility and sell yourself to big clients </li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	<p>When Dan got out of hospital he rebuilt his client list... only to fall ill again with an even more serious condition: both Diabetes and Kidney failure. Once again – he lost every client.  That is when Dan knew he had to find a better way. A way to systematize – what seemed impossible to automate.

	<div class="middle_bullets">
	<ul>
	<li>How much money can one reasonably expect to earn with a linkbuilding business?</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	</div>
	<p> After years of trial and error Dan developed and refined a system for building a “White-Hat” SEO Agency.  An agency that runs (and gets clients) on auto-pilot --- even if Dan has to disappear for months at a time battling his own body. 
	</p>
	<p>Dan, in his early 30s, is &rsquo;retiring&rsquor; from client work.   Dan now shows others how they can build an agency the proper way: by providing “White Hat” link building. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Google is on the war path looking for SEOs that use shady tactics.  Out of desperation, SEO consultants have focused on trying to "game" the search engines – with weirder and weirder tricks.  It does not work; Google destroys their clients’ businesses.
	</p>
	<img src="dan_vertical.png">
	<p>
	The only thing that works – that really works -- is mastering pure 'White Hat', quality link building.  The strange truth is: the big clients, the best paying clients, the clients you most want to work with – will only pay for a ‘White Hat’ service.  “White Hat” is where the money is.  Crime truly does not pay.  
	</p>
	<p>
	Getting website owners, journalists, and bloggers to take a REAL genuine interest in your client’s content is tough.  Especially if they are in a boring industry.  Dan ‘cracked the code’ and is now revealing his system to those who want to build a REAL agency that runs on auto-pilot.
